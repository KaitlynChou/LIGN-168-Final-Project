# LIGN-168-Final-Project

## Content Descriptions
LIGN168_Final_Project_Kaitlyn_Chou.ipynb is a copy of the Google Colaboratory Notebook. 
changeformants.praat is the main script I used, but the entire Praat Vocal Toolkit is also included.
The folder "Test sound files" contains the wav files I used to test my function. They are played directly in the Colab Notebook. 

## HOW TO LISTEN TO OUTPUT AUDIOS:
* Click the orange "Open in Colab" button on the LIGN168_Final_Project_Kaitlyn_Chou.ipynb notebook.
* You do not have to run anything.
* Scroll down to the "Testing with Google TTS Voice" section.
* Click the play button on the sound bars to hear the outputted audio of the code cell above.
